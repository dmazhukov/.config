# .config
Properly managed dotfiles for macOS.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Requirements
These dotfiles were written for **macOS**. With some minor modifications, they might be usable on
another Unix-based OS, but I have not tested them on anything else than macOS.

## Installation
1.  [Fork this repo](fork).
1.  ‚ö†Ô∏è Edit [`git/.gitconfig`](git/.gitconfig) in your fork (you can do this through GitHub's web
    UI) to use _your_ name and email address, not mine!
1.  Open a terminal and do the following:
    ```shell
    % cd ~                  # Go to your home dir.
    % mv .config .config~   # Back up your old .config dir (if any).
    % # Clone your fork, which will make a new .config dir:
    % git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USER NAME>/.config.git
    ...
    % cd .config    # Go to your new .config dir.
    % # üìù Add anything you want to keep from your old dotfiles.
    % make install  # Run the installer to deploy your new dotfiles.
    ...
    % # Finally, update your fork with your changes:
    % git add .; git commit; git push
    ...
    %
    ```
1.  _(optional)_ In Terminal.app, go to Preferences, import
    [`terminal/Dark Mode.terminal`](terminal/Dark%20Mode.terminal) and set it as the default.
1.  Restart your terminal.

## Getting Updates
To get new updates to your fork from my repo, do the following:
```zsh
% cd ~/.config
% make          # Pull in updates from upstream, but don't install them yet.
...
% # üìù Review the incoming changes and make any adjustments you like.
% make install  # Run the installer to deploy your changes.
...
% # Finally, update your fork with your changes:
% git add .; git commit; git push
...
%
```
